# Connect to the EC2 Serial Console<a name="connect-to-serial-console"></a>

You can connect to the serial console of your EC2 instance by using the Amazon EC2 console or via SSH\. After connecting to the serial console, you can use it for troubleshooting\. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Troubleshoot your Windows instance using the EC2 Serial ConsoleTroubleshoot your instance using the EC2 Serial Console](troubleshoot-using-serial-console.md)\.

+ [Prerequisites](#sc-prerequisites)

+ [EC2 Serial Console fingerprints](#sc-fingerprints)

## Considerations<a name="sc-considerations"></a>
+ Only one serial console connection is supported per instance\.
+ The serial console connection lasts for a minimum of one hour\. The session lasts during instance reboot and stop\. During reboot, you can view all of the boot messages from the start\.
+ Supported serial console port for Windows: COM1

When you connect to the serial console, you might observe a slight drop in your instance’s throughput\.

## Prerequisites<a name="sc-prerequisites"></a>
+ Supported instance families:
  + A1
  + C5, C5a, C5ad, C5d, C5n, C6g, C6gd
  + M5, M5a, M5ad, M5d, M5dn, M5n, M5zn, M6g, M6gd
  + R5, R5a, R5ad, R5d, R5dn, R5n, R6, R6gd
  + T3, T3a, T4g
  + Z1d
+ All IAM users who will use the serial console must have the required permissions\. For more information, see [Configure IAM policies for EC2 Serial Console access](configure-access-to-serial-console.md#serial-console-iam)\.
+ The instance must be in the `pending`, `running`, `stopping`, or `shutting-down` state\. If the instance is `terminated` or `stopped`, you can't connect to the serial console\. For more information about the instant states, see [Instance lifecycle](ec2-instance-lifecycle.md)\.
+ To connect to Windows instances, the Special Admin Console (SAC) must be enabled\. For more information, see [Troubleshoot your Windows instance using SAC](troubleshooting-sac.md)\.

You do not need an sshd server installed or running on your instance\.

### Connect using the browser\-based client<a name="sc-connect-browser-based-client"></a>

You can connect to your EC2 instance's serial console by using the browser\-based client\. You do this by selecting the instance in the Amazon EC2 console and choosing to connect to the serial console\. The browser\-based client handles the permissions and provides a successful connection\.

**To connect to your instance's serial port using the browser\-based client \(Amazon EC2 console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select the instance and choose **Connect**, **EC2 Serial Console**, **Connect**\.

   Alternatively, you can select the instance and choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**, **EC2 Serial Console**, **Connect**\.

   An in\-browser terminal window opens\.

1. Press Enter\. If a login prompt returns, you are connected to the serial console\.

   If the screen remains black, you can use the following information to help resolve issues with connecting to the serial console:
   + **Check that you have configured access to the serial console\.** For more information, see the [Configure IAM policies for EC2 Serial Console access](configure-access-to-serial-console.md#serial-console-iam)\.
   + **Restart getty\.** If you have SSH access to your instance, then connect to your instance using SSH, and restart getty using the following command\.

     ```
     [ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl restart serial-getty@ttyS0
     ```
   + **Reboot your instance\.** You can reboot your instance by using the EC2 console or the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Reboot your instance](ec2-instance-reboot.md)\.

### Connect using your own key and SSH client<a name="sc-connect-SSH"></a>

You can use your own SSH key and connect to your instance from the SSH client of your choice while using the serial console API\. This enables you to benefit from the serial console capability to push a public key to the instance\.

**To connect to an instance's serial console using SSH**

1. **Push your SSH public key to the instance to start a serial console session**

   Use the [send\-serial\-console\-ssh\-public\-key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2-instance-connect/send-serial-console-ssh-public-key.html) command to push your SSH public key to the instance\. This starts a serial console session\.

   If a serial console session has already been started for this instance, the command fails\. It takes approximately 30 seconds between API calls before a new session can be established\.

   ```
   C:\> aws ec2-instance-connect send-serial-console-ssh-public-key \
       --instance-id i-001234a4bf70dec41EXAMPLE \
       --serial-port 0 \
       --ssh-public-key file://my_rsa_key.pub \
       --region us-east-1
   ```

1. 

**Connect to the serial console using your private key**

   Use the ssh command to connect to the serial console before the public key is removed from the serial console service\. You have 60 seconds before it is removed\.

   Use the private key that corresponds to the public key\.

   The user name format is `instance-id.port0`, which comprises the instance ID and port 0\. In the following example, the user name is `i-001234a4bf70dec41EXAMPLE.port0`\.

   The format of the public DNS name of the serial console service is `serial-console.ec2-instance-connect.region.aws`\. In the following example, the serial console service is in the *us\-east\-1* Region\.

   ```
   C:\> ssh -i my_rsa_key i-001234a4bf70dec41EXAMPLE.port0@serial-console.ec2-instance-connect.us-east-1.aws
   ```

1. 

**\(Optional\) Verify the fingerprint**

   When you connect for the first time to the serial console, you are prompted to verify the fingerprint\. You can compare the serial console fingerprint with the fingerprint that's displayed for verification\. If these fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a "man\-in\-the\-middle" attack\. If they match, you can confidently connect to the serial console\.

   The following fingerprint is for the serial console service in the us\-east\-1 Region\. For the fingerprints for each Region, see [EC2 Serial Console fingerprints](#sc-fingerprints)\.

   ```
   SHA256:dXwn5ma/xadVMeBZGEru5l2gx+yI5LDiJaLUcz0FMmw
   ```
**Note**  
The fingerprint only appears the first time you connect to the serial console\.

1. Press Enter\. If a prompt returns, you are connected to the serial console\.

   If the screen remains black, you can use the following information to help resolve issues with connecting to the serial console:
   + **Check that you have configured access to the serial console\.** For more information, see the [Configure IAM policies for EC2 Serial Console access](configure-access-to-serial-console.md#serial-console-iam)\.
   + **Restart getty\.** If you have SSH access to your instance, then connect to your instance using SSH, and restart getty using the following command\.

     ```
     [ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl restart serial-getty@ttyS0
     ```
   + **Reboot your instance\.** You can reboot your instance by using the EC2 console or the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Reboot your instance](ec2-instance-reboot.md)\.
